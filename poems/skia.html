      There exists a funny sort of man
      <br />In society’s throes <br />He resents those above him <br />And those
      below him <br />Yet he does as he’s told
      <br />
      <br />He wakes up at seven <br />He brushes his teeth and frowns
      <br />Then he eats the same cereal <br />Every day of every week <br />As
      he listens to the dull traffic sounds
      <br />
      <br />Reduced to a shadow with no will <br />It never occurs to him
      <br />To rebel against the tyranny <br />Because he is convinced
      <br />That to be mediocre is normal
      <br />
      <br />And so he lives his mundane life <br />Until he retires <br />At
      which point he finds himself <br />None the wiser, and desiring more.
      <br />
      <br />To be complicit with the hypocrisy <br />That society ensconces us
      with <br />Is in itself cause for concern <br />But when we comply and see
      no benefit <br />Then it is time to surrender <br />To the invisible Man
      up in the clouds.
