      Barefoot in the sand
      <br />I watch white waves unfurl themselves upon the shore <br />Drenched
      in the warmth of the sunset
      <br />
      <br />I see a person walk towards me <br />A strange familiar face
      <br />She takes my hand and wants to lead me <br />To a place she calls my
      home
      <br />
      <br />But I wouldn’t like to leave <br />I’d like to see the stars at
      night fade into my sight <br />To hear the crashing of the tide against
      the rocks <br />And look at the lighthouse cast its torch beyond the
      horizon
      <br />
      <br />Yet she does not falter <br />She rips me further and further apart
      <br />From what I wish to do <br />Confused, I follow hesitantly to her
      house <br />And now I look at lifeless concrete <br />Like a noose around
      the sanctity of paradise
