      I pity the fool who lays down at night
      <br />Ignorant to the vast expanse of the cosmos <br />and all that lies
      within.
      <br />
      <br />Every morning of every day wallowing in misery <br />A tedious
      repetition of the past <br />As should be expected from a being whose
      imagination <br />is limited to the primitive confines of unenlightenment.
      <br />
      <br />He sees the boundless ocean <br />and knows not what means made it
      present <br />But curiosity manages to pierce into his thoughts
      <br />
      <br />He sails out to venture into the unknown blissfully,
      <br />Pathetically hopeful that he will find the key to life <br />Instead
      meeting a swift and painless end <br />to his sorrows in the shallows.
      <br />An abrupt end to an abrupt actuality.
      <br />
      <br />And yet, as pondering gets the better of me, I reappraise <br />The
      sheer drear of existence plagued him not; <br />It is much easier to be
      illiterate <br />than to fret over matters not within conscious control
      <br />I understand now. <br />I envy the fool.
