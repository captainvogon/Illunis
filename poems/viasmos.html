      Beside a blind lamp at night
      <br />A lady dips her quill <br />The nib racing illegibly across
      parchment <br />Contrasts with the view out the window
      <br />
      <br />Itâ€™s coming, she knows <br />Faster than wind <br />And though she
      is well aware <br />That none will read what she writes <br />Solace comes
      to her <br />In the form of a trembling hand
      <br />
      <br />Blood curdling screams from outside <br />Make her flinch <br />But
      she forges on <br />For the belief that one may outrun the end
      <br />Afflicts all
      <br />
      <br />To be in the face of the storm <br />To feel what lies beyond
      <br />Is reason enough to madden <br />But to know and accept quietly
      <br />Is insanity
      <br />
      <br />Dawn draws near <br />And the woman fears no more <br />She resigns
      to her fate <br />But chooses to go out on her own terms <br />And so the
      quill lies still in the ink <br />As light swallows the dark
