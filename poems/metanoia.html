      What a lovely night,
      <br />Not an animal in sight <br />And no one to watch me head home
      <br />I see colors in white <br />and the cold winter plight <br />of
      creatures that venture into the unknown
      <br />
      <br />For hours I walk <br />Shivering, distraught <br />Up till I reach
      my shack <br />Then I cradle the fire <br />And now I admire <br />The
      screams emanating from my basement
      <br />
      <br />As I walk down to the door, <br />A softer voice implores,
      <br />Pleads and begs to be freed <br />But I know he must suffer
      <br />Lest some other <br />Be the victim of his horrid vile deeds
      <br />
      <br />“Get up”, I say, <br />“I’ve been away today, <br />Here’s some
      water and some food. <br />You know better than to whine; <br />To atone
      for your crimes, <br />So don't ruin my mood.”
      <br />
      <br />Now I am become God, <br />Free from the facade <br />That everyday
      life brings to mortals <br />If I decide who dies, <br />Who lives and who
      cries <br />Then why must I be bound by morals?
      <br />
      <br />What a lovely night, <br />Not an animal in sight <br />In the
      distance I see red and I see blue <br />I know my time is up <br />So I
      sigh and I shrug <br />And I offer my life to the noose
