      Metal rings in the distance
      <br />As I jar myself awake <br />To the sound of discord <br />Tearing
      into my mind
      <br />
      <br />The Painkiller is here <br />He offers to help <br />He pities me,
      for I see visions <br />He tells me it is a disease
      <br />
      <br />I reach out towards his hand <br />Only for sleep to crawl back into
      my eyes <br />Overwhelmed by injection
      <br />
      <br />I wake a second time <br />And see him stand before me with my
      reflection <br />And in it I see my scalp is stitched closed <br />And my
      eye blurs black and white into gray <br />As red bleeds into the sheets
      <br />
      <br />I cannot scream <br />But I am happy now
