      In the quiet hours of dawn
      <br />when the world is wrapped in shadows and silence <br />I sit and
      ponder the fragments of my soul <br />scattered like stars in the vast
      expanse of night
      <br />
      <br />I find that a part of me is empty <br />and I wait in hope that
      someone will come along <br />whose emptiness does not intersect with mine
      <br />and so together we may become whole.
      <br />
      <br />And each time I draw a breath, <br />I am careful not to fill the
      void's lungs, <br />lest it feed the void's heart <br />and circulate
      through the void's body, <br />expanding the hollow ache within.
      <br />
      <br />But perhaps, in this waiting, <br />the emptiness will only grow,
      <br />and the silence will deepen, <br />until it becomes a part of me.
      <br />
      <br />I fear that in the end, <br />I will remain alone, <br />a void
      within a void, <br />lost in the vastness, <br />with nothing but echoes
      to keep me company.
