      I know now what I should not know
      <br />I know of natureâ€™s aberrations <br />And I see what I must do
      <br />
      <br />We are sick <br />Infected by beings <br />That manifest themselves
      <br />into our collective unconscious
      <br />
      <br />They are the cause of morality <br />We are limited by Them
      <br />They are corrupt <br />And led by ungodly intentions
      <br />
      <br />I must cleanse the Earth <br />For death is better <br />Than to be
      slaves <br />To mindless suffering
      <br />
      <br />They are everywhere <br />Inside everyone <br />We were not meant to
      feel pain <br />Thus will I bring <br />The dawn of a new age <br />We
      will be reborn pure
      <br />
      <br />There is no escape <br />No other way <br />We can only accept
      <br />And stare into the deafening silence <br />Of the beyond
